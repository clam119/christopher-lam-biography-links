# Introduction 
This is a project that was inspired by LinkTree, which is a website that enables the user to put their social media details for other users to click on and view.

I created this project with the intent to revisit HTML/CSS and to implement very basic JavaScript in the form of DOM (addEventListeners) and Vanta.JS which is a small neat framework to provide animation in the background.

## Difficulties
I've often struggled to get concepts revolving the box model and other CSS features that can really bring a website out to life, and so this project has enabled me to build on common features like adding box-shadows and such.
